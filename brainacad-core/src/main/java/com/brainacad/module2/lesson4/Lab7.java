/*
Write a program that computes the distance an object will fall in Earth's gravity.
Create a new class called GravityCalculator with method calcDist(double t)
that takes double  t, and returns the the position of an object
after falling for t seconds (outputting the position in meters). The formula in Math notation is:
x(t) = 0.5 Ã— at 2 + vit + xi
Where:
a - Acceleration (m/s 2 ) =-9.81
t - Time (s) (for example t=10)
vi Initial velocity (m/s) =0
xi Initial position =0
Declare Acceleration value field as a constant;
