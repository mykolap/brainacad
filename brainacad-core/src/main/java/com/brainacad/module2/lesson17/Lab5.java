/*
Create new project called TestThread3. Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testthread3”.
1. Write a program in which one thread increments an integer 1,000,000 times,
and a second thread prints the integer (without waiting for it to finish).
2. Implement three classes: Storage, Counter, and Printer. The Storage class should store an integer.
The Counter class should create a thread that starts counting from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) and stores each value in the Storage class.
The Printer class should create a thread that keeps reading the value in the Storage class and printing it.
 3. Write a program that creates an instance of the Storage class and sets up a Counter and a Printer object to operate on it.
 4. Now modify the program to use a condition variable to signal completion of the addition task by the first thread
  before the second thread prints the value (using Wait/Notify Mechanism). 5. Execute the program.
  The program output must be like next example: 0 1 2 3 … 999999
