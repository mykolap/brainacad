Create new project called TestThread5. Add package “com.brainacad.oop.testthread5”.
Consider a class Bank with a number of accounts.
Transactions are randomly generated that move money between these accounts.
Several threads simulate the transfer of random amount of money from a given account to another random account.
The class Bank has a method transfer(), which transfers a given amount from one account to another.
A template for the class Bank is given in next pages. 1)
The first task is to complete the class Transfer that transfers a random amount of money
from a given account to another random account in a bank (use an infinite loop);
this class will be executed by multiple threads concurrently.
2) Complete the code in BankTest to spawn N_ACCOUNTS Transfer threads with an initial balance: INITIAL_BALANCE.
The output should be similar (but not exactly identical)
 to: from: 0 to: 2 amount: 410
 from: 3 to: 0 amount: 105
 from: 1 to: 1 amount: 77
 from: 2 to: 2 amount: 713
 from: 4 to: 3 amount: 524
 Total balance: 3581

 from: 0 to: 4 amount: 927
 from: 0 to: 4 amount: 768
 from: 0 to: 1 amount: 647
 from: 0 to: 0 amount: 539
  Total balance: 3147

  from: 3 to: 1 amount: 457
   Total balance: 3403 ...

   from: 0 to: 4 amount: 633
   Total balance: 2941

   from: 2 to: 3 amount: 662
   Total balance: 3353
